New to JavaScript and just wanna make stuff. Critisism is appreciated and taken into cansideration. Pretty good a coding json files though. If you need help with Minecraft Bedrock Resourse Pack creation I can help. I am also willing to to help make 3d models for almost anything. I don't exactly know what I want to make, but I want to make something.
